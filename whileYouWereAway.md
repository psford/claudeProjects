## Pending Tasks

- [ ] **Tablet responsive layout fix** - At ~1100-1200px width, the search/options area in the upper left has poor layout: search box truncated, labels wrapping badly, "Compare to" cramped. Need better breakpoints or flex-wrap behavior.
- [ ] **Cloudflare IP allowlist** - Update App Service to only allow Cloudflare IPs
- [ ] **Image ML quality control** - Reject images where cat/dog face can't be reasonably cropped
- [ ] **CI dashboard** - Build dashboard to visualize CI runs and builds
- [ ] **Brinson attribution analysis** - Major feature for mutual fund evaluation (needs planning)

## Blog Ideas

- [ ] "LLMs are border collies" - analogy for working with AI assistants
