# Tasks

1. ~~Add a future enhancement request for a static analyzer for code security.~~ **DONE** - Installed Bandit, created helpers/security_scan.py. Rule: No code merged to main without passing scan. 
2. ~~Add a new guideline to evaluate whether or not you are really using the information that is read into the context window.~~ **DONE** - Added as guideline #22 (context window efficiency / hot-cold storage). CLAUDE.md is persistent storage. 
3. ~~Another guideline is to write local code wherever possible to prevent unneeded calls to Claude cloud.~~ **DONE** - Added as guideline #24 (local helper code over API calls). helpers/ folder created with security_scan.py as first tool. 
4. I know I have  my preferred languages, but if all of this could be more efficiently written in C# and .net, I'd be open to that. Here's a big ask - fork this project and recreate it all using C# and .Net libraries (and any dependencies you need). Please also create a new folder structure to manage the new project. Let me know if you need access, but I expect you to handle all of the user testing on your own. As you know, user experience matter over everything - it doesn't matter if the code compiles if you can't meet the requirements.  
5. I won't always be home at this PC - please evaluate ways that you could communicate with me remotely so we can bounce ideas off each other. Ideally this would be through imessage. If that's not possible, SMS is a second choice and email a third. Feel free to offer other suggestions (as always, question me and suggest better options if you have them). If you need to build a separate application for communication (as I suspect you will) we can do that, but let's disucss the approach before you start working. As stated earlier, this is tooling that can be used in the future, so let's take the time now to make it robust and modular. 
6. ~~Look through your dependencies and see if rules.md is referenced anywhere.~~ **DONE** - File was empty, deleted.
7. Give me suggestions on how we could add dynamic analysis security tools to our SDLC. 
8. Any time I start a prompt with "as a user" add that to the functional requirements. 
9. Review the roadmap and propose user stories. Show me a description, probable acceptance criteria, and a suggested epic. Refer to all the work we are doing when determining the epic. Description should be in the proper user story format. If you don't know that format, search the Internet before asking me. In fact, "check the web before asking Pat" should" also be a guideline. 
10. Let's also start archiving log files. Write a script that archives any logs older than 14 days when those log files start taking up more than 1gb. We'll test this for a while, but add it as a future enhancement when we either start up or shut down.
