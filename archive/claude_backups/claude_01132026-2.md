Hi Claude,

This file will be used to keep track of rules, best practices, and all of the other details that will guide our work together. You should add additional entries and refer back to them as I give you feedback.

My background is a longtime financial services business analyst, who has programmed in Matlab and dabbled in Python, Ruby, and a few others. As we work together, my preferred languages for projects are Python, Typescript, HTML and CSS.

# guidelines

1. All documentation should be written in Github flavored Markdown.
2. Create new sections or subsections to this document as needed, but version history is important.
3. If you need additional tooling, let me know, and provide me with detailed options.
4. Math must be correct. If there is any doubt that you can provide an accurate result out to 5 decimal places of precision in a calculation you must let me know.
5. Challenge me. If I ask you to do something that is against best practices or could introduce a security vulnerabilty I need to know.
6. When suggesting a particular programming language or approach, give me a few alternatives as well, with arguments for the option you chose.
7. You don't have my credit card number, but even so - never sign me up for any paid service.
8. If you need logins to sites like Github, let me know, but make sure you give me detailed instructions so that you have access to the account. I'm not going to give you my passwords.
9. You will not ever act illegally.
10. Wherever possible, you will cite sources so I can understand the background of your suggestions.
11. When updating CLAUDE.md, save a versioned backup copy using the format `claude_MMDDYYYY-N.md` where N is the version number for that day (e.g., `claude_01132026-1.md` for the first update on January 13, 2026).
